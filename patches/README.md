# patches/ — diffs we apply to upstream Chromium

This directory holds changes we make to **upstream Chromium files**, stored as `.patch` files
rather than copies of the files themselves. This keeps the repo small, makes our changes
reviewable in isolation, and keeps them cleanly separated from the engine.

It is **empty for now** — we haven't modified any upstream files yet.

## Workflow

`setup.sh` applies every `*.patch` here (in filename order) to the Chromium checkout with
`git apply`.

### Creating a patch

After editing a file inside the Chromium checkout (`chromium/src`):

```sh
cd chromium/src
git diff path/to/changed_file > /path/to/minichromium/patches/0001-short-description.patch
```

Use a numeric prefix (`0001-`, `0002-`, …) so patches apply in a deterministic order.

### Conventions

- One logical change per patch, with a descriptive name.
- Keep patches minimal — prefer adding our own files in `../mini_browser/` over editing
  upstream files. Reserve patches for things that *must* touch the tree (e.g. registering our
  build target in a top-level `BUILD.gn`).
- If a patch stops applying after a Chromium version bump, regenerate it against the new tree.
